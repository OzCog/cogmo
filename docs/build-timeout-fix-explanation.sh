echo "OLD PROBLEMATIC APPROACH (DO NOT USE):"
echo 'cd /home/runner/work/cogml/cogml && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev guile-3.0-dev cython3 python3-nose valgrind doxygen'

echo "PROBLEMS with the old approach:"
echo "- Single large install command can timeout"
echo "- No error resilience if one package fails"
echo "- Verbose output can cause log size issues" 
echo "- No way to retry individual failed packages"

echo "----------------------------------------"
echo 'sudo apt-get update -q'
echo 'sudo apt-get install -y -q build-essential cmake'

echo "BENEFITS of the new approach:"
echo "- âœ… Smaller commands less likely to timeout"
echo "- âœ… -q flag reduces log verbosity"
echo "- âœ… Can identify which specific package fails"
echo "- âœ… Individual retry possible for failed packages"
echo "- âœ… Progress visible during installation"
